    "Geospatial Data Scientist with 8+ years of experience, passionate about leveraging remote sensing technology to address planetary challenges",
  summary:
    "I have a broad interest in the application of geospatial and remote sensing technologies to address environmental and societal challenges at scale. My background is in Remote Sensing & Oceanography, but since then I have branched out into data science, geospatial analysis, and software development. Iâ€™m particularly excited by the convergence of physics-based simulations (especially radiative transfer), remote sensing and machine learning. Take a look at my portfolio, and if youâ€™d like to collaborate, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!",
