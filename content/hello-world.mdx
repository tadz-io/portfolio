summary: "Data used to be retrospective—a record of what happened. Today, it’s something far more powerful: a living resource that can anticipate, adapt, and evolve. At the intersection of biotechnology, AI, and systems science, data is being harnessed not just to understand human potential, but to expand it."

## Computer vision and physics-based rendering

In traditional science, data followed discovery. You ran the experiment, then analyzed the output. Now, data is baked into the beginning. With machine learning and computational biology, researchers can simulate outcomes, stress-test hypotheses, and refine models before a single sample is touched. Discovery is no longer linear—it’s iterative, intelligent, and faster than ever before.

Genomics and synthetic biology are generating vast, complex datasets that describe life at its most fundamental layers. AI tools are turning that data into dynamic insight—predicting protein behavior, modeling disease pathways, or even designing new biological components. We're not just interpreting the genome. We're starting to speak its language.

console.log("Hello World");

*anilla* markdown on its own does not provide any other level of customization, but after some research I did determine that there are indeed some external solutions, outlined below, of which none quite met my needs.

<img 
    src="/images/sentinel-2.jpg" 
    alt="Hyperspectral satellite" 
    class="block mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg max-w-full md:float-left md:mr-4"
    style="width: 300px; height: auto;"/>

My ultimate problem with my renderer was related to how it displayed images. In regular markdown, to include an image you use syntax. Then, when rendered, markdown places an image in between the text above and below the image declaration. When I write blogs, however, I often want to include many different images of the same thing, or same content. A grid of graphics to showcase every perspective of an object or a sequence of photos to display a process. 'Vanilla' markdown on its own does not provide any other level of customization, but after some research I did determine that there are indeed some external solutions, outlined below, of which none quite met my needs.
